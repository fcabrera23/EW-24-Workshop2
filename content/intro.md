In this workshop, you will cover how to use AKS Edge Essentials to automate and run your containerized applications. You will then learn how to connect industrial equipment and sensors to an Azure IoT Opeartions platform, managing containerized applications and workloads across on-premises and cloud environments, using AI to optimize processes, and deploying software updates efficiently.

After you complete this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether AKS Edge Essentials is appropriate to automate and run your IoT operations, and describe how AKS Edge Essentials provide cloud-native best practices to your edge application, by using a lightweight Kubernetes platform with a small footprint and simple installation experience.
